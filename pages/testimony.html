            <div class="header">TESTIMONY OF ANNE WALTERS</div>
            <div class="bodyText">
                <p>ANNE WALTERS was born one stormy wintery day on 
                    January 18, 1935 on a farm near Truax, Saskatchewan.  
                    Her mother and father, John and Maria Epp, because of 
                    the bad weather had to deliver her alone, even without 
                    a doctor or midwife.</p>
                <p>
                    Anne grew up there and attended the school in Truax 
                    until she was age 13, in Grade VII.  One day, at the 
                    age of 9 her sister, Kathy, led her to the Lord.  When 
                    she was 13 her family moved to Hawarden, Saskatchewan.  
                    She then attended a small country school, Cosmopolitan 
                    School, which was situated across the road from our farm.
                      She took Grade VI and VIII there.  Then she took 
                    Grades IX and X by correspondence with the help of the 
                    teacher from the school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1953 when she was 18 years old, she went to Saskatoon 
                    to take a Secretarial Course at a vocational Training 
                    School.  Then she worked for a Law firm for a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While attending the Alliance church in Saskatoon at a 
                    Missionary conference, she went forward to dedicate her 
                    life to the Lord for full-time service, even the mission 
                    field.  Anne had a strong desire to learn more about the 
                    Bible and how to effectively share her faith so in 
                    September of 1954 she went to Briercrest Bible Institute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She attended this school for 3 years, taking any job she
                     could get during the summer to make adequate funds for 
                     school and expenses.  One summer she worked as a 
                     telephone operator in Moose Jaw which was a delightful 
                     experience.  During two Christmas 2-week breaks, she 
                     went with a group of students to work at the Sanatorium at 
                     Fort Qu’Appelle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduation in the spring of 1957, she went to work for 
                    the Canadian Sunday School Mission as Secretary and also did 
                    camp work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After inquiring Missions Boards, she discovered she needed her 
                    High School diploma so in the fall of 1958 she went to Regina 
                    College to take a condensed High School course and got her diploma 
                    after much hard work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was while she was there, that she met Alvin Walters, 
                    who was there for the same reason.  They became interested in 
                    each other and sensed God’s leading in their relationship and in 
                    June of 1959 they were engaged.  In June 1960 they were married in 
                    Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Al had already started ministry in a small work at Horseshoe Bay, 
                    B.C. and so at this time, Anne joined him and they served the Lord 
                    together there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were blessed with four children during their life together:
                     namely, Debra (1963), Denise (1965), Deanne (1967), and Dale 
                    (1971).  What a joy and blessing these children were to them.  
                    The were also blessed with many grandchildren: Mitchell (1989), 
                    Matthew (1991), Jonathon (1995), Jeffrey (1995), Rachel (1998), 
                    Jayson (1999), Simon (1999), Joshua (2002), Kaylin (2004) and 
                    Rebekkah (2006).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every time they applied or inquired about Missions, the doors closed 
                    so they continued ministry in many churches: such as Revelstoke, B.C., 
                    Trail, B.C., Penticton, B.C. Drumheller, AB, Kindersley, Sask., North 
                    Battleford, Sask..  In 1984 they moved to Fort Macleod to church plant, 
                    something they both had a desire to do.  It was a very slow, hard work 
                    for about 10 years and then growth came, they saw people come, accept 
                    the Lord and become a part of a great group of people.  In 1999 they 
                    helped build a church building which was a great accomplishment.  
                    The church dedication occurred in May, 2000 and they then retired and 
                    moved to High River, AB in June 2000.  They continued in part-time 
                    ministry through their retirement years as they were able.  The Lord was 
                    so good to Anne and Alvin through their years of service in both leading 
                    and supplying their every need abundantly.
