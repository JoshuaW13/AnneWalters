                    Anne Walters, beloved wife of Alvin Walters of 
                    High River, AB passed away on Friday, June 3, 2022 
                    at the age of 87 years. Anne was born on a farm near 
                    Truax, Saskatchewan, on January 18, 1935.   She 
                    married Alvin Walters in 1960 and they have lived 
                    together in the community of High River, AB since 2000. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides her husband Alvin, Anne is survived by her 
                    loving and devoted children and their families: Debra 
                    Mulligan (husband Greg, son Jonathan and daughter 
                    Rachel); her late daughter Denise Romanuk 
                    (husband Doug, sons Matthew, Jeffrey and Jayson and 
                    her estranged son Mitchell); Deanne Walters-Sprague 
                    (husband Brent, son Simon and daughter Rebekkah); and 
                    Dale Walters (wife Cheri-Lynn, son Joshua and daughter 
                    Kaylin). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She is also survived by her sisters Katherine Dyck, 
                    Helen Doekson and Frieda Epp, along with several nieces 
                    and nephews. She is preceded in death by her parents, 
                    John and Maria Epp; and siblings (John, Marie, Tina, 
                    David, Jake and Susan).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anne will be most remembered for her faithfulness in 
                    serving the Lord in ministry for over 40 years alongside 
                    her husband Alvin. Together they pastored many churches 
                    throughout B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan under 
                    the Christian and Missionary Alliance Organization between 
                    1960 – 2000.  After retirement to High River in 2000 they 
                    continued in part-time ministry there for another 10 years.  
                    In particular, Anne was very active in children’s and women’s 
                    ministries.  Anne’s focus was on providing a good home for her family.  
                    Throughout her lifetime, she spent many hours in prayer for her 
                    husband, children, church family, missionaries, and anyone that the 
                    Lord laid on her heart.  She truly was a living example for those 
                    around her of the scripture verse James 5:16 “The prayer of a righteous 
                    person is powerful and effective”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anne was always thinking of her family, encouraging them and 
                    supporting them in prayer.  One special thing that she did was 
                    to write her life story and have it printed as a book, opening it 
                    with a dedication to her family.  She wanted to leave a record of 
                    God’s goodness and faithfulness over the years, and her appreciation 
                    to her family for their support and love.
                </p>
                <p>

                    service at High River Alliance church on June 18, 2022 at 2:30 pm.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Anne’s living wish was to spread the gospel of Jesus to as many 
                    people as possible. If family and friends so desire, in lieu of
